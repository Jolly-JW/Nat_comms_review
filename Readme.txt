Software dependencies: 
The main software required includes:
Matlab (R2023a), Python (3.11.3), MNE (1.7.1), Fieldtrip (v. 20230716), R (4.3.1), LME4 (1.1-34)
More or less recent versions of these packages should work. Note, Python, MATLAB and R are programming languages, 
while MNE, Fieldtrip and LME4 are the primary packages used for running analyses in each of these languages (respectively). 

Installation guide:
As long as the required dependencies are installed, the scripts included should run. Note you will have to adjust 
the paths to ensure each script can access the required file. Each script includes a brief statement of the 
requirements to run that script (i.e., the packages and dependencies, and data file required). All scripts should
run on the most recent versions of the required packages, alongside the software dependencies stated above. 

Install time can vary, but the main software packages, Python, MATLAB and R, can be expected to be installed in 
around 20 minutes. 

Demo:
Instructions for running each script is included in that script. The expected output is also mentioned. Run times
for each script are relatively short, however depends on the file size. Each script gives an estimated time. 
Note that the data included is example data, as the actual file sizes are quite large.
